# Modern Control in Matlab and Simulink

Welcome to the "Modern Control in Matlab and Simulink" GitHub repository! This repository serves as a resource for exploring various modern control techniques implemented in Matlab and Simulink. The repository is organized into four folders, each focusing on different aspects of control theory.

## Contents

1. [LQR Control](#lqr-control)
2. [LQG and LQGI Controllers](#lqg-and-lqgi-controllers)
3. [Compensator Design](#compensator-design)
4. [Kalman Filter vs State Space FB Control](#kalman-filter-vs-state-space-fb-control)

## LQR Control

The `LQR Control` folder contains Matlab and Simulink code for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control technique. This powerful control strategy is designed to optimize the performance of a system by minimizing a quadratic cost function.

### Instructions

- Explore the Matlab code for the implementation of LQR control in Matlab.
- Simulate the behavior of the LQR controller using the provided Simulink model.

## LQG and LQGI Controllers

In the `LQG and LQGI Controllers` folder, you'll find code for both Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) and Linear Quadratic Gaussian Integral (LQGI) controllers. These controllers combine optimal control (LQR) with state estimation (Kalman filter) to enhance system performance.

### Instructions

- Check out the Matlab code for the implementation of LQG and LQGI controllers in Matlab.
- Use the Simulink models to simulate the behavior of these controllers.

## Compensator Design

The `Compensator Design` folder focuses on compensator design techniques in control systems. This includes the design of compensators to improve stability, transient response, and overall system performance.

### Instructions

- Review the Matlab code for various compensator design techniques.
- Experiment with the provided Simulink models to visualize the effects of different compensator designs.

## Kalman Filter vs State Space FB Control

The `Kalman Filter Vs State Space FB Control` folder compares the performance of Kalman filtering and State Space feedback control. Explore the implementation in Matlab and simulate the behavior in Simulink.

### Instructions

- Examine the Matlab code for Kalman filtering and State Space feedback control.
- Utilize the Simulink models to observe and compare the behavior of these techniques.
